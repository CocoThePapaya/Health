Exercising is fantastic. You shouldn't do it.<br><br>

If you've been picking up what I've been putting down, you're probably going through a lot of life changes. What you've been eating is completely different. Weighing food constantly is still getting some taking used to. Mentally budgeting this snack versus what you've already spent on the day is still not your forte. You don't have a hang of having a light breakfast and lunch to allow for a bigger dinner.<br><br>

Why do you want to start something else new and challenging? Exercising takes extra time out of your busy day, makes you uncomfortable and tired, and requires commitment. My concern is that when you set up a modest goal of running 30 minutes twice a week, and skip a few sessions, you start spiraling into 'Oh, I can't exercise, I'll never lose weight, what's the point?' and end up right back at square 1. You end up stopping both exercising and monitoring what you eat. But you didn't fail - you set yourself up to fail and then succeeded at failing. <br><br>

Additionally, some people use food as a reward for exercising. The reward of cake, or beer, or french fries might actually be more calories than what you burned off. It takes months of practice to be able to get your body to the point where it can handle the amount of exercise needed to burn calories.<br><br>

Stick to one thing - calorie monitoring. Get good at that. Make it as natural as everything else you've done that you've succeeded at. (It'll only take about 2 months of constant practice. That's not very long, is it?) Then, when tracking what you eat comes naturally, strap on a pair of sneakers and go for a run. Even if it turns out you'd rather go for a swim then a run, while you're finding your exercising passion you'll still be succeeding at your weight loss plan. With the skin hanging off from your thinning frame, you'll be even more eager to hit the gym anyway, right?<br><br>
