Which statement is more common?<br><br>
"I'm going to eat healthy to lose weight. "<br><br>
"I lost weight by eating healthier."<br><br>

When trying to lose weight, the refraim is 'eat healthier.' What is healthy? Why can some people eat unhealthy and be trim, but some people on a diet of pure health food can't lose weight at all?

I have purposely not used the word 'healthy' to describe eating habits. Healthy is not measureable. Healthy is not the same from one person to another. Your idea of healthy may be an apple. Mine is having a beer once in a while so I don't play the 'One more?' game one Friday night and wake up to a $70 bar tab and a splitting headache. <br><br>

What people think of as healthy eating isn't measurable, and it certainly isn't sustainable. How often do you want to eat a salad? Is it always? That is both unhealthy and healthy. Sure, lettuce spinach tomato cucumbers and feta cheese with a light vinaigrette 10 times a week seems healthy, but creating an unreasonable goal and failing is not. If you've been accurately monitoring your portions, you probably figured out the advantage of eating what's considered 'healthy' once in a while. Having a light salad or a filling chicken breast for lunch means a big dinner and dessert at your favorite restaurant later. Skimp on what you don't care about to indulge in what you love.<br><br>

Count calories, eat what you like - even if it's classically categorized as unhealthy - and you'll achieve your weight loss goals. <br><br>
