By now, you've been tracking calories for a few weeks now. Have you ever taken a look back at your logs? All this data tells a story. Is there a common thread between days where you went over your calorie budget? Did you skip breakfast and eat a big lunch? Too much snacking? Drank too much? <br><br>

What foods did you eat on days where you stuck to your budget? Did you bring leftovers for lunch, or only have half a donut instead of 2 at the meeting? Did you remember to have a light salad for lunch to compensate? <br><br>

I bet if you compare the two kinds of days, you'll find that when you had a rough plan of what you wanted to eat, you did a lot better than days where you were at the mercy of fast food restaurants. If you can plan what you want to eat before you get hungry, you remove one of the constraints on food preperation - time. <br><br>

Now you have a great reason to hate surprise birthday parties: you feel compelled to plan for cake. <br><br>
