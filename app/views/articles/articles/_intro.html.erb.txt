This website will not make you lose weight.<br><br>

This website will not make you lose weight, because no website can make you lose weight. The decisions you make each day will decide if you lose weight. It is one hundred percent up to you if you end up with a great body and happy mind.<br><br>

What this website can do is help you along your weight loss path by showing you what’s important. As you log your calorie macros from the previous days, you’ll open up more articles about how to improve your eating habits. The articles will start basic, like how to read a nutrition label and what is a calorie. (The stuff you were expected to learn, but never really did.) Later, we’ll switch to the mentality it takes to keep losing weight and keep it off.<br><br>

This website will also not tell you what you can and can’t eat. Restricting your diet works if you don’t like what you can’t eat to begin with. Low carb seems like a great idea, until you crave, order, and eat an entire pizza. (Trust me, I’ve done them both.)<br><br>

This website will also not create a workout plan for you. If your goal is to lose weight, then focus on the big picture of controlling what you eat. Exercising is great, I love it, I couldn’t have ran a marathon if I thought it was a waste of time, but unless you’re already a gym rat then wait until you get nutrition part down before you buy running shoes or a membership to the local fitness center. <br><br>

All along the way, you’ll be developing habits that you can carry not just until you reach your ideal weight, but afterwards.<br><br>

In any long-term project, it’s important to remember that what you do today. Losing 5, 20, 70 pounds can’t happen overnight - and it can’t happen if you don’t start today. <br><br>

First things first: please record how much protein, carbs, and fat you ate yesterday in the 'Calories' tab. (And if you don't know, it's ok to guess. This time.)
