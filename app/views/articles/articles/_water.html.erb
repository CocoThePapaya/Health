Water - very cheap, quite filling, readily available, helps clear out junk in your body. <br><br>

Weight loss focuses on restriction: what can't you eat? When can't you eat? Time to change that. Have as much water as you can handle. Water is essential to life. Water is pretty cheap nowadays - it comes standard in most homes, apartments, and places of business. Restaurants give the stuff away - and that's a business that operates on razor-thin margins. <br><br>

Why push water so hard? You drink when your thirsty, and that's good enough. Think about when and why you eat. A lot of the time, it's because you're hungry. What if you just chugged an absolutely insane amount of water? How full would you feel? You can't give up all foods, but you can do a pretty good job of tricking yourself into not being hungry a little while longer if you drank a couple more glasses of water. When lunch or dinner roll around, you can eat a sensible amount of food.  <br><br>

Plus, it's the original fat-free zero-calorie beverage. (Water executives: call me. We'll do something.)<br><br>
