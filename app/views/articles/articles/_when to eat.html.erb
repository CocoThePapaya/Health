There's been a lot of ideas about when to eat. Skip breakfast, have a big lunch, eat 6 small meals, don't eat after 5/6/7/8 PM, don't eat carbs late.<br><br>

Eat when you want to and you can. Focus more on avoiding situations where you are hungry and are forced to choose between E7 and D4 in the vending machine - you know you're going to be unhappy with either. If your breakfast and lunch are filling enough to get you home to dinner without any snacking, then that's your plan. For my daily allotment of around 1900 calories, I shoot for 4-500 calorie meals for breakfast and lunch. That way, I can snack if I want to without feeling obligated to skip dinner. You might like a more rigid approach - being able to plan exactly what you want to eat that week makes grocery shopping much easier. Logging meals is a lot easier when you can copy & paste yesterday's breakfast, lunch from last week and Sunday's dinner. <br><br>

As you readjust your eating habits, you'll find out how your body's appetite responds to meals. The rumbling of an empty stomach is the classic sign of your body saying 'Hey, eat something.' If you don't, you lose energy and focus - which might as well be 'lose any ability to have willpower.' Being able to just be hungry, instead of famished, is an important distinction that you'll have to practice on your own.<br><br>

The only important timing aspects that matter to weight loss is eating when you're hungry, and logging what you eat immediately. <br><br>
