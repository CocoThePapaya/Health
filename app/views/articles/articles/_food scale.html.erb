When I was about 9 years old, I received monster-making a kit. It was a simple concept: make something like clay, filll a mold with it and then paint the objects to look like Frankenstein's monster or a wolfman. The directions were simple: mix 2 cups of water with the package of powder to make the clay. To this day, some twenty years later, I remember the exact kind of cup I used: one of the yellow cups I'd use for milk. I filled them up to the top, made the mix, then wondered why it was so runny. All my monsters fell apart like my paintbrush was a pitchfork. <br><Br>

The directions were for a cup of water. I used the same cup I had been using for all of my young life. What went wrong?<br><Br>

Was it easy to put in how many calories you ate? Or did you just make up a number that seemed right? 'Well, breakfast was a bowl of cereal, yogurt and a banana, that's healthy right? I got diet soda with my burger, and for dinner I had a salad with chicken. That's about 2000 calories."<br><Br>

The problem people have with weight loss is the disconnect between the amount of calories eaten versus the amount of calories thought to have eaten. Research has shown that people estimate calories poorly. It may seem easy, but that's only because you've never been told you've failed. Most people think they're horrible jugglers - why? Because they see themself fail. <BR><BR>

That's why the single most important piece of weight loss equipment is a food scale. Not weights, not a treadmill, not a juicer, not a bathroom scale. Accurately measuring food tells you how many calories you ate. Accurately measuring calories allows for better adjustment of eating habits. The slice of cheese you put on your quarter-pound burger could have 100 calories, or 50 calories, or 150. That 'quarter-pounder' patty could weigh 4 ounces, or 6. That salad could have a tablespoon of blue cheese dressing, or a half-cup. A bag of potato chips says 10 servings when 3 people ate the entire thing. <br><Br>

With measuring comes recording. An accurate food log not only keeps you on track of how many calories you ate, but lets you see trends. Did changing your lunch result in feel starving at 3, so you head to the snack machine to grab a candy bar? Now you know that you need to bring an apple or orange from home. Have a weekly tradition of Pizza Fridays or Bear Claw Monday? A food log lets you plan around those calorie-laden events by looking at previous meals you've enjoyed that don't have as many caloires. <br><Br>
